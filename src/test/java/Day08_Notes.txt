*****If you cloned a project, to get same latest code from github:
If branch name is master:
*git reset --hard origin/master
If branch name is main :
*git reset --hard origin/main
*Note:
This will reset your project.
It will delete if you have your own codes/notes
Be careful when you use it, since it will bring the same copy of the github code

We can't test windows application with selenium. But we can use JAVA to test.
 We can use Java to check if a file exist on our computer or not
System.getProperty("user.dir"); =>gives the path of the current folder
System.getProperty("user.home"); =>gives you the user folder
Files.exists(Paths.get(“path of the file”)); =>Checks if a file path exist on your computer or not
We can use this Java concept to check if a downloaded file is in our download folder
